            <h2><b>DESIGN APPROACH</b></h2>
            <h3>Design & Development Methodology</h3><br />
            <p>
                After researching a range of different design methodologies such as waterfall and sequential methods, our group has decided to choose an <b>Agile Development Methodology</b>. <br /><br />This design methodology allows for flexibility and adaptation in case of possible changes. Due to the potentially unexpected nature of the system in terms of add-ons or edits, agile is the most efficient option in ensuring our project remains successful. <br /><br />The aim of our group is to respond to the unpredictability of the child care needs, by working in increments of no longer than 4 weeks, achieving a certain task, then seeking feedback and implementing changes throughout the process. These increments will be repeated throughout the entirety of the project. This process will ensure bugs are caught and fixed throughout the process instead of the end. This process will also ensure that the client is receiving what they want, in order to develop the most beneficial system.
            </p>
            <br /><br />
            <h3>Development Environment</h3>
            <p>
                To develop a web-based system, a lot of decisions need to be made regarding the development and deployment environment, as tools used and frameworks need to be able to build on each other, in order for it to be compatible and work properly. We have also considered group members’ previous experience with developing environments and tools to be able to find the common ground, and to learn new technologies that are commonly used.<br /><br />
                The system is going to be developed in Windows and Linux environments, since all the developers have access to a Windows platform. Linux environment is going to be used to run the server, and in order to be independent of a platform it’s running on, Ubuntu Server is going to be set up with virtual machine, such as VirtualBox.<br /><br />
                Tools, frameworks and libraries that are going to be used in our development environment are described below.
            </p><br />
            <p><u>Frameworks and Libraries </u></p>
            <p>
                <b>ASP.NET Core 1.1</b><br /><br />After a thorough research, we have determined that <b>ASP.NET Core 1.1 </b> framework would suit better for a web application, which follows <b>Model-View-Controller (MVC) </b>application pattern, as demonstrated on the diagram below. MVC pattern enables easier testing of application components as it is flexible to changes without affecting the other parts of our application. Also, ASP.NET Core is an open-source cross-platform framework, which is one of the main reasons to choose it over standard ASP.NET framework, as it can run on multiple platforms and simplifies the process of deploying a system.
            </p>
            <img src="Images/MVC.png" alt="MVC" height=" 250" width="70%" />  <br /><br /><br />
            <p><b>jQuery</b><br /><br /><b>jQuery</b> is a widely used, lightweight and feature-rich Javascript library that simplifies the client-side scripting of HTML. It allows direct DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation and extensibility through <b>plug-ins</b>, while it is supported in most web browsers.</p>
            <br />
            <p><b>Bootstrap</b><br /><br /><b>Bootstrap</b> will be utilised, which is a front-end framework that consists of reusable components that are implemented as CSS classes. Also, it gives developers the ability to pick features that are only necessary. It furthermore consists of a grid system that can be customised and that dynamically adjusts to the proper screen resolution, which is useful if applications need to be suitable for different devices. Additionally, there is good documentation and a large community behind it.</p>
            <br />
            <p><u>Programming Languages</u><br /><br />As ASP.NET framework is used, <b>C#</b> will be implemented for server-side code, and <b>Javascript</b> is going to be used for client side code, along with <b>HTML, CSS, and SQL</b>.</p>
            <br />
            <p><u>IDE</u><br/><br /> Since we’re going to implement ASP.NET Core framework, Visual Studio Community 2017 (<a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/">https://www.visualstudio.com/</a>) is going to be used as <b>IDE</b>. Bootstrap and jQuery easily integrate with Visual Studio, which is another reason why it is suitable as IDE. Visual Studio provides drag-and-drop controls, statement completion, syntax checking and other IntelliSense features that saves developers’ time.</p>
            <br />
            <p><u>Version Control</u><br /><br /><b>Github</b> will be utilised, which is a web-based version control repository that allows to collaborate with others while developing the project. Also, the project repository can be directly managed from a Visual Studio, which makes it easy to keep up-to-date with the changes other members have made, and simplifies pushing modifications or additions to the project.</p>
